# ISSUES:
# Lots of shaven yaks for this demo. Fixed some bugs here and there, but there are still issues to be addressed for Audioform to be fully functional.
#
# ProvisionedThroughput in sound templates dynamo causes throtthling. Change BillingType to PAY_PER_DEMAND
# Mastering ocasionally times out.
# Encoder cannot find a file, or throws an error 'Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)' in ~20% of cases.
# Add productionId to encoder's response
