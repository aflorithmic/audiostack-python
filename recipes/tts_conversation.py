Good morning, Coco! How are you today?
</as:section>
<as:section name='s0'>
Hi Wren! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How about you?
</as:section>
<as:section name='m1'>
I'm good, thanks. So, Coco, I heard you recently completed a marathon. How was the experience?
</as:section>
<as:section name='s1'>
Oh, it was incredible! Crossing that finish line after months of training was such a rewarding feeling. The atmosphere, the support from fellow runners and spectatorsâ€”it was all so motivating.
</as:section>
<as:section name='m2'>
That sounds amazing. What inspired you to take on such a challenge?
</as:section>
<as:section name='s2'>
Well, I've always been passionate about pushing my limits and staying active. Running a marathon was a personal goal of mine for a long time, and I finally decided to commit to it this year. Plus, I wanted to raise awareness and funds for a charity close to my heart.
